info:
  name: OpenSSH CVE-2024-6409 
  author: bahlawi89
  severity: high
  description: |
     A race condition vulnerability was discovered in how signals are handled by OpenSSH's server (sshd).
     If a remote attacker does not authenticate within a set time period, then sshd's SIGALRM handler is called asynchronously.
     However, this signal handler calls various functions that are not async-signal-safe, for example, syslog().
     As a consequence of a successful attack, in the worst case scenario, an attacker may be able to perform a remote code execution (RCE) as an unprivileged user running the sshd server.
